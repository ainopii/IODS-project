## Introduction to Open Data Science 2023

I'm doing my PhD in a neuroscience research group where most people are focused on (wet) lab work. However, my own interest is more in data science. My earlier MSc studies introduced me to the basics of **R** but now it's time to take a next step. I am delighted that this kind of course exists. I hope this gives me inspiration, increase and keep up my motivation in this path I have chosen.

I found this course originally in *UEF Yammer* last year.
